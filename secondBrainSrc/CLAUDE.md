# Second Brain Implementation Plan

## Current Status

- ✅ **Learner Module**: Functioning - can record keystroke events with app context and store them in PostgreSQL
- ✅ **Thinker Module**: Building successfully - can analyze captured events and generate summaries
- ✅ **Recall Module**: Building successfully - can query and retrieve summaries via TCP server
- ✅ **Common Module**: Fully implemented - provides database and LLM interfaces for all modules

## Implementation Completed

### 1. Common Module Fixes ✅

- [x] Implemented proper error handling and added missing functions in `GeneralDbClient`
- [x] Completed implementation of the LLM client interface and Ollama client
- [x] Added database schema creation for both PostgreSQL and SQLite
- [x] Fixed warnings related to unused variables by using underscore prefixes

### 2. Thinker Module Fixes ✅

- [x] Resolved import issues with the LLM client
- [x] Implemented proper summary generation from events
- [x] Fixed the `ActivitySummary` struct usage  
- [x] Ensured accurate handling of tags and metadata
- [x] Fixed variable references and type issues

### 3. Recall Module Fixes ✅

- [x] Fixed syntax error in the `process_query` function
- [x] Implemented the missing and incorrect methods for `QueryEngine`
- [x] Fixed the formatting of `UserEvent` objects
- [x] Ensured proper implementation of fuzzy searching capabilities
- [x] Implemented basic natural language querying functionality

### 4. Integration and System Improvements ✅

- [x] Configured database schema creation system for both PostgreSQL and SQLite
- [x] Implemented proper environment variable handling via dotenv across all modules
- [x] Added basic console logging with emojis for better user feedback
- [x] Added documentation in code comments for key functions

### 5. System Configuration

- [x] Created a central .env file for all configuration settings
- [x] Configured the necessary database connections for all modules
- [x] Ensured proper error handling throughout the codebase

## Next Steps

1. **Testing and Refinement:**
   - Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
   - Test the system with real-world usage
   - Refine the keylogger to handle more edge cases
   - Improve the query capabilities in the recall module

2. **Feature Enhancements:**
   - Implement more advanced LLM prompts for better summaries
   - Add more sophisticated pattern recognition
   - Create a simple web interface for browsing captured data
   - Implement data visualization for activity patterns

3. **Production Readiness:**
   - Add proper security measures for sensitive data
   - Optimize database queries for better performance
   - Add data retention policies
   - Implement proper error handling for edge cases

## Running the System

The Second Brain system is now fully implemented and ready to run. You can start the different components as follows:

```bash
# First, make sure your databases are running
docker-compose up -d

# Start the learner to capture keystrokes and events
cargo run -p activity-tracker-learner

# Start the thinker to process events and generate summaries
cargo run -p activity-tracker-thinker

# Start the recall service to query and retrieve summaries
cargo run -p activity-tracker-recall
```

## Interacting with the System

### Exploring Captured Events

To view captured events in the database:

```bash
# View the most recent events
docker-compose exec timescaledb psql -U postgres -d second_brain -c "SELECT * FROM user_events ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 10;"

# Count events by application
docker-compose exec timescaledb psql -U postgres -d second_brain -c "SELECT app_name, COUNT(*) FROM user_events GROUP BY app_name ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;"

# Extract key data from a few events
docker-compose exec timescaledb psql -U postgres -d second_brain -c "SELECT timestamp, app_name, event_data::json->>'key' as key FROM user_events ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 5;"
```

### Querying Summaries

You can query the system using the TCP interface provided by the recall module:

```bash
# Send a natural language query
echo "What was I working on today?" | nc localhost 8080

# Use fuzzy search
echo "Fuzzy:coding" | nc localhost 8080
```

## Dependencies and Environment

- **Databases**:
  - TimescaleDB (PostgreSQL) on port 5435 for event storage
  - SQLite for activity summaries
  
- **LLM Integration**:
  - Ollama running locally on port 11434
  - Using llama3.2:3b model for summarization
  
- **Development Tools**:
  - Rust 1.70+ with tokio async runtime
  - Various Rust crates for keyboard input (rdev), window tracking (active-win), and database access (sqlx)

## Configuration

All configuration is managed through the `.env` file:

```
# Database connections
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5435/second_brain
SUMMARY_DB_URL=sqlite:./data/summaries.db

# Ollama LLM settings
OLLAMA_HOST=http://localhost:11434
OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.2:3b

# Application settings
POLL_INTERVAL=1
THINKER_INTERVAL_SECS=300
```
